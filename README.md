## Welcome in Study Help!

I built application in order to learn and improve my skills as a frontend-developer. This gives me the opportunity to test various technical practices used in everyday work, such as application state management, event handling, creating my own functional components using available hooks etc.

## Description

An application aimed at gathering tools that increase the efficiency of learning. Currently includes 3 tools:

Notebook
Creating notes, with the possibility of editing and deleting them. Notes are saved in the browser's local story.

Pomodoro
A tool designed for people who are often distracted while learning. It allows for a rigid determination of learning time and breaks, which makes learning more organized and easier to fulfill previously established assumptions. The learning time frame, breaks and the number of intervals can be created individually depending on the needs and progressed in subsequent days. The time view is available in every view of the application.

Flashcards
A particularly useful tool when learning foreign languages or definitions. It is possible to create many different decks of flashcards. After completing the test from a given deck of flashcards, the results of the entire test are displayed. Flashcard decks are saved in the browser's loocal story.

Currently, work to implement further functionalities such as:
-monitoring the progress of study

- creating a learning plan
  -enhanced the ability to create more complex notes
  -assigning tasks to a specific date.

The following was used to create the application:
-TypeScript
-React
-React-router
-Redux
-gh-pages
